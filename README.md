# MyReads Project

React project that creates a bookshelf. This bookshelf allows a user to organize searched books into 3 different categories: Read, Want to Read, Currently Reading.

## Install

To get started developing right away (iOS):
* Make sure git is installed: `$ git --version` will idicate if git is installed.
* Clone project with `git clone https://github.com/johnson882/reactnd-project-myreads`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
